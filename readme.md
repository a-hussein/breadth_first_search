# Breadth First Search

Finding shortest path in an m x n maze using Python. Followed "Tech with Tim" tutorial on Youtube.

## Description

* Employed Breadth First Seearch algorithm to findest shortest path. 

## What I Learned

* Gained a deeper understanding on the BFS algorithm. Analogy to a the base of a tree and going through each layer of branches. Then
going through the next layer until a shortest path is found. It is interesting to note that the shortest path can be found using this way since 
the algorithm tracks each path it has taken.
